# CTR-Prediction-ML
📊 Click-Through Rate (CTR) Prediction Using Machine Learning 🚀

## 📖 About the Project
In the digital advertising world, **Click-Through Rate (CTR) Prediction** is crucial for **maximizing ad revenue, optimizing user engagement, and reducing wasted ad spend**.  
This project uses **Machine Learning (Random Forest Classifier)** to predict whether a user will click on an advertisement based on **user behavior, ad characteristics, and contextual data**.

## 🔥 Why This Matters?
✅ Enhances **ad targeting accuracy**, increasing engagement 🎯  
✅ Reduces **advertising costs** by preventing irrelevant ad displays 💰  
✅ Speeds up **real-time ad placement decisions** ⚡  
✅ Can be integrated into **digital marketing platforms & ad networks** 📊
